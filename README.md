Your Task:
You are working for a Scandinavian woodland management organization and are asked “to investigate if there are any links between herbivore [large mammal] grazing, the species composition of the heath understory in a Pine forest and the soil characteristics of each site”. This is a very generic statement, but you are a trained in environmental statistics, so you set out to investigate the request statistically and write a report on your findings.
